## Minter fails to call `updateCollateral` during the required interval and the Update Collateral Interval is later changed 
### Given the Update Collateral Interval is originally set to 24 hours and is then later changed to 1 hour
### When Minter updates their collateral with 1,500,000 tokens
### Then their collateral must be 1,500,000 tokens
### When Minter mints 1,000,000 tokens to Alice
### Then Minter's active owed M balance must be 1,000,000 tokens plus 1 wei
### Then Alice's balance must be 1,000,000 tokens
### When Alice burns 250,000 tokens but Minter failed to call `updateCollateral` for one collateral interval
### Then Minter is penalized once when updating their collateral
### Then Alice's balance must be 750,000 tokens
### When the Update Collateral Interval is set to 1 hour and Alice burns 250,000 tokens 12 hours later
### Then Minter should be penalized again since the interval changed
### Then Alice's balance must be 500,000 tokens
### When the Update Collateral Interval is set to 48 hours and Alice burns 250,000 tokens 36 hours later
### Then Minter should not be penalized again since the new interval prevails
### Then Alice's balance must be 250,000 tokens
