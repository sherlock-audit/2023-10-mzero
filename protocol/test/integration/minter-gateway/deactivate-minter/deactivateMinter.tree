deactivateMinter.t.sol
└─ Minter fails to call `updateCollateral` during the required interval and the Update Collateral Interval is later changed
   ├─ Given the Update Collateral Interval is originally set to 24 hours and is then later changed to 48 hours
   ├─ When Minter updates their collateral with 1,500,000 tokens
   ├─ Then their collateral must be 1,500,000 tokens
   ├─ When Minter mints 1,000,000 tokens to Alice
   ├─ Then Minter's active owed M balance must be 1,000,000 tokens plus 1 wei
   ├─ Then Alice's balance must be 1,000,000 tokens
   ├─ When Minter fails to call `updateCollateral` for one collateral interval
   ├─ Then Minter is penalized once when updating their collateral
   ├─ When the Penalty Rate is changed to 48 hours and `deactivateMinter` is called before the new collateral interval deadline
   ├─ Then Minter should not be penalized again and Minter `inactiveOwedM` balance should be equal to the principal plus the previous penalty
   ├─ Then Minter `activeOwedM` balance should be 0
   └─ Then Minter should be deactivated
